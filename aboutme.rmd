### *Introduction*
As a boundary-spanner who thrives on connecting people, I have come to know music as my most important tool for building connections. With a strong knowledge of your organization's mission and values, I am confident that my background and commitment will serve well in supporting company progress. 

### *Music*
Since a very young age, I developed a passion for music and a fondness for the piano over time. I currently enjoy playing jazz and accompany several talented musicians playing other genres in Berlin on various projects. Some of which you will also find linked on this website. I keep myself updated with musical trends and keeping horizon broad by not limiting myself to one music genre.

### *Studies*
During my engineering studies at the HTW Berlin I developed an interest in data science. At a later point I found the combination of economics and sociology the perfect fit to deepen my knowledge in statistics while still including cultural and societal aspects in my studies. Through my supplementary subject and focus on organizational sociology, I am particularly aware of the importance of proficient analysis for all dependencies to achieve rational decision-making. 

### *Strengths*
Throughout courses in R and STATA, I became familiar with the modern tools of data analysis and the endless possibilities in editing, analyzing, and visualizing data. Next to the process of data wrangling and cleaning, I also have a deep understanding of descriptive and inferential statistics. A solid foundation of well-analyzed data always needs to be at hand, visualized, and communicated adequately to those making the decisions. 
Furthermore, my work at New Beings has taught me how important it is to question the status quo and challenge established structures by continuously re-evaluating them to effectively bring about change that creates added value for all parties involved. In doing so, I became aware of key elements which occur frequently as obstacles to process change, which helped me better understand the importance of teamwork.
